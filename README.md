### Project Title
WeRateDogs Twitter Data

### Description
Using data from WeRateDogs twitter handle, I wanted to get a deeper understanding of the data through analysis  to observe trends and possible correlations between different metrics. To do this we did statistical calculations, sample distributions and multivariate analysis. The aim was to see if patterns would emerge and how that can be used to better understand user behavior. The popularity of the account  has been increasing  over time and provides insight into where interests lie and how the field its evolving. As a result, this work is able to identify popular dog breeds, their ratings and other user behavior in retweets and favoriting.
